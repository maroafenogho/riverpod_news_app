# Riverpod News

This is a tutorial project built with flutter 3.7.0.

The app would give you a good understanding of the following:

- Riverpod basics (the little parts you need to build an app with riverpod)
- Abstraction
- API integration and more

## Getting Started

To use the app, clone the repo, create your developer API key on the guardian news site <a href="https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/">here</a>, navigate to <strong>app_utils.dart</strong> and replace <i>your_key</i> with your API key. Run the app on your emulator or physical device and watch the magic happen.

Happy coding. ðŸ¥³
